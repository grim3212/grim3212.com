When looking through the configuration files you may come across a property that looks like this.
<br>

<div class="card bg-light">
  <div class="card-body">
    <pre><code>
S:"Blocks allowed when restrict powerstaff is active" <
    dirt
    grass
    cobblestone
    stone
>
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

<br>This corresponds to a list of item or blocks depending on the context. You can use basic registry names so
<em>minecraft:dirt</em>
or
<em>grimpack:repulsor</em>. But you can also do some special things.
<br>You can add meta by adding an extra colon and appending the meta or a
<em>?</em>
for any meta.
<br>
<strong class="text-info">Example: 'dye:4', 'minecraft:dye:?', 'modname:item:meta'</strong>
<br>These lists also support the OreDictionary using similar tags following the basic pattern
<em>oredict:orename</em>. The oredict tag also supports meta just like the previous by appending a number or '?'
<br>
<strong class="text-info">Example: 'oredict:dye:2' (So all dyes will meta 2) or 'oredict:dye:?' (So all dyes with any meta)</strong>
