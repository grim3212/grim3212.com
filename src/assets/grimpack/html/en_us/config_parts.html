One major way that you can affect how you play with GrimPack is by
<i>enabling/disabling</i>
parts that are included. As you may know GrimPack is divided into parts, each part having its own theme. Using the core config file you can disable a complete part.
<br>

<div class="card bg-light">
  <div class="card-body">
    <pre><code>
parts {
      B:"Enable cuisine part"=true
      B:"Enable decor part"=true
      B:"Enable industry part"=true
      B:"Enable tools part"=true
      B:"Enable util part"=true
      B:"Enable world part"=true
}

subparts {
      B:"Enable aluminum subpart"=true
      B:"Enable coal subpart"=true
      B:"Enable graphite subpart"=true
      B:"Enable iron subpart"=true
      B:"Enable rubber subpart"=true
      B:"Enable steel subpart"=true
}
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

<br>Another way to affect a large portion of GrimPack is to disable subparts these subparts can be found in each parts config file and pertain to a group of common
<i>item / blocks / entities / etc</i>. When you disable it everything that pertains to that subpart will be disbaled as well.
