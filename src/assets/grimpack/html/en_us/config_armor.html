<br>All values for armor material can be modified.
<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <em>durability</em>
    refers to how long the armor will last. This value is multiplied differently for each piece.
    <ul>
      <li>durability * 11 for the helmet</li>
      <li>durability * 16 for the chestplate</li>
      <li>durability * 15 for the leggings</li>
      <li>durability * 13 for the boots</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>reductionAmounts</em>
    refers to the number of armor points the player gets for wearing each piece of armor. Follows the same pattern of first helmet, then chestplate, leggings, and finally boots.</li>
  <li>
    <em>enchantibility</em>
    refers to how enchantible the material is. The higher the number the better enchantments are likely to appear.</li>
  <ul/>
