GrimPack is built with
<a href="http://files.minecraftforge.net/">Minecraft Forge</a>
so the first thing to do would be to install that. Then you would need the mod itself.
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-danger">You can get it from
  <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/grim-pack">Curse Forge</a>, if you got it from somewhere else it is not official. You should immediately remove it and download the official version.</strong>
<br><br>
Once you have installed Forge simply drop the
<i>GrimPack-MCVersion-ModVersion.jar</i>
into your mods folder and you are ready to go.
